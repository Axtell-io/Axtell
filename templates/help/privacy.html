        <h3 id="error-tracking">Error tracking</h3>
        <p>Axtell performs error tracking which automatically reports any JavaScript errors which occur when you are on the page. With errors, context is also submitted being the events as described in <a href="#usage-tracking">Usage Tracking</a>. A random 'instance id' is also randomly generated and is associated with all errors reported for a given pgae. This 'instance id' is accessible from the console on the Axtell client and can be used in explicit requests to identify a given report.</p>

        <h3 id="data-sharing">Data Sharing.</h3>
        <p><strong>None</strong>. Your data is never shared, never used for advertising, and never sold.</p>
