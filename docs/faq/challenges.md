### What kind of challenge can I post?
Axtell is a place to solve programming challenges, but with some _objective metric_. This means there is some quantity you can calculate to determine which answer ranks above another[^even though, for example, answers in two languages are not directly comparable]. 

### Who can post challenges?
Anyone can write a challenge on Axtell. If you're a new user, your challenge will go through the review process (sandbox) where you'll recieve feedback before it goes public. However, once you've started to earn points, this process will be waived.
