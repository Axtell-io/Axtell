### What languages can I use?
Axtell natively supports over 60 languages however you can use any language.
Right now custom languages are under development but you can fill out the
[language proposal form][propose-language].

### How do I propose a new language?
To propose a new language to be natively supported use the Axtell
[language proposal form][propose-language].

### What are the requirements for proposed languages?
They are no 'requirements' for languages however we do have recommendations when
submitting for the best experience:

  - Have a SVG logo of the language
  - Create a syntax highlighting spec
  - Know the encoding your language uses
    - If your language uses a custom encoding specify this along with a link to
      the codepage.

Even if your language does not fullfill these critera, feel free to submit as
almost all languages will be accepted.
