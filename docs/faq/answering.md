### What is an answer?
Axtell is a site where you can create or solve programming challenges. To submit your solution of a challenge you can create an answer.

### What languages can an answer use?
Axtell supports a wide variety of languages and you can submit any language to be added. For more information see the [language FAQ](./languages#what-languages-can-i-use).

### How are answered scored?
Answered are scored depending on the challenge type. The most common type of challenge is _code-golf_ which is scored based on the amount of _bytes_ (not characters) in your answer. Challenges can have custom scoring metrics, or be of a custom type such as _KotH_ (King of the Hill) or _cops-n-robbers_.
